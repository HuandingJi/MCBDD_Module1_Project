# MCBDD_Module1_Project
Includes the projects for the MCBDD course at UniBas

The main.py is a python file which contains the script used to do the Task 2 in Module I. 

The codes in main.py was run multiple times with different independent variables, and generated different visualizations. The visualization plots are saved in the plots folder. 

The visualizations in plots are the ones that I used to formulate conclusions in Task 3. 

Calculations, thought processes, and details are written in the PDF file
